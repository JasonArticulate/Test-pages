Updates & Changes:
Banner Improvements:

It looks like the header and the top section ("Best creative digital online courses") need better alignment and spacing.
Add a background image or gradient overlay for visual depth behind the "Best creative digital online courses" section to avoid a flat appearance.
Typography Adjustments:

The heading ("Best creative digital online courses") is impactful, but the smaller text underneath appears crowded. Increase line spacing (line-height) to improve readability.
Reduce the font weight slightly for subheadings to give them a more polished appearance and differentiate from the main headline.
Alignment & Spacing:

The navigation text ("All Courses, How It Works, About") at the top could use more padding to avoid feeling cramped.
Introduce horizontal padding on the sides of the main content to make the whole page feel less squished, improving the overall layout.
Image Integration:

I see a missing or placeholder image for the main banner with the tagline. Add a high-quality, relevant image behind the main heading text to improve engagement.
You uploaded an image; I can include it in the main banner to enhance visual appeal.
Interactivity:

Add hover effects to buttons like "See more" for better user interaction.
Introduce subtle animations when users scroll down the page, for sections like "Hands-on Activity: Sculpture" or "Life Skills: Online Safety," for more dynamic navigation.
